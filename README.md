# Lalolagi
Final Project for CSE-210
Developer: Andrew Clarkson

<summary>
This project was named "Lalolagi" for it's meaning. In Samoan, it means "World" and
the overall focus of this project is to create an effective world creator a player 
can travel in.

Nov. 23:
    Lalolagi is a top-down rpg with a focus mostly towards world generation. The thought 
towards this is having components of inventory, enemies, and traveling around the map. 
The map is initially planned to be created through perlin noise. Once the generation is 
working, the focus will then be to add a character you can move, and etc. 
    Most components from the brick and batter project were put into here as well. I think
I can use most of those things after modifying a chunk of what the code was originally
there for.
