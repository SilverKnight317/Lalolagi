# Lalolagi
Final Project for CSE-210
Developer: Andrew Clarkson

<summary>
This project was named "Lalolagi" for it's meaning. In Samoan, it means "World" and
the overall focus of this project is to create an effective world creator a player 
can travel in.

Nov. 23:
    Lalolagi is a top-down rpg with a focus mostly towards world generation. The thought 
towards this is having components of inventory, enemies, and traveling around the map. 
The main plan for the project additions:
1: prepare world map creator
2: controllable player
3: spanwable enemies
4: inventory and potential merchant to sell/buy from
    Most components from the brick and batter project were put into here as well. I think
I can use most of those things after modifying a chunk of what the code was originally
there for.
